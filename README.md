Our bug report is about LRR assignment submission: we think that it should be another button for request submission (late submission) for a student who was not able to do the submission on time. The student tape on that button gives the reason for non-submission on time, and if the teacher thinks that reason is valid enough then the student is allowed to resubmit his/her work.
